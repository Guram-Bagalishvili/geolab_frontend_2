## My process

- Before coding i identified the structure of design and write it down. Then i realized what was the best way to group objects. 
After that i start thinking what techniques should i use for positioning elements in specific places. Then i start to code.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

How to use the position property in CSS - ```position: relative; position: absolute;```

The position Property -	static - An element with position: static; is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
				relative - An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
				fixed - An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport.
				absolute - An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
				sticky - An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

### Continued development

In the next project I want to focus on CSS Transitions.

### Useful resources
